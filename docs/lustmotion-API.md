# Remote Control API

## MDNS

LUST-motion is discoverable by MDNS services und advertises a `stroking` service. This can be used to identify the device on the local network and establish connections with it. The following service texts provide further information:

| Text            | Information                                                                 |
| --------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| FirmwareVersion | Currently used firmware version to adjust for API versions and capabilities |
| DeviceID        | Unique device ID                                                            |

## Stateful Services

Stateful services offer direct control over the machine and can be reached via a RESTful API. Some stateful services are also offered through a websocket server or MQTT. All changes are internally synchronized and propagated back to all clients. Redundant messages which do not change any internal state are filtered out and not propagated.

> **_⚠️ IMPORTANT:_** There is a rate limit to these updates. You should avoid more then 10 Hz, otherwise the API might become unstable and could cause a fatal crash.

### StrokeEngine Control

The main control API to control LUST-motion. Starts and stops the motion, changes the main parameters depth, stroke, speed and sensation. Also allows the selection of a pattern, or if the streaming interfaces should be used as input source for the motion generation. In addition it provides the possibility to override the vibration overlay with fixed costume values. If enabled, vibration commands from pattern or streaming are ignored.

### StrokeEngine Safety Limits

This API can be used to restrict the mechanical reach of the machine and limit the maximum speed attainable. These soft limits will be used to truncate any control value coming through the [Control API](#strokeengine-control) or the streaming interface.

}
```

#### MQTT

Environment messages are always send with the flag `retain` and QoS = 1 to make it available for all new consumers. Environment messages are sent out whenever it connects to the broker or the topic is reconfigured. Additionally a MQTT client may request an environment JSON by sending a payload with "environment" to the environment topic.

### StrokeEngine Streaming _write-only_

Instead of pattern the motion commands can be provided via this streaming interface, too. Messages are queued up with a queue length of 5. Writing to a full queue will result in the message being discarded. An empty queue will stop the motion. Changing `command` in the [Control API](#strokeengine-control) will erase the queue. That way streaming always starts with a fresh queue. This service is write only. Changes won't propagate to other clients and a GET request will return an empty JSON.

## Websocket Raw Data Streaming

> Defined in `WebSocketRawDataStreaming.h`

A constant stream of position, velocity and other parameters are available on a websocket connection. These values are send in a binary CBOR format and contain an array of several data points for a given time slot. The binary format is chosen to save bandwidth and typically 5 data points are aggregated into one message to reduce the message rate. This can be used as a direct user feedback of what is happening with the machine.
